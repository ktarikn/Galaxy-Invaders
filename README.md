# Galaxy-Invaders
Think of Space Invaders™ but you are free to move in the space, and shoot sideways (But there are minimal visuals)

Compile and run the Main.java file (Game.java needs to be in the same directory)
You are the red square, move around using WASD keys shoot but clicking with curser on the window.
Green are allies they and their violet projectiles can't hurt you,
Black are the enemy (that sounds so wrong, sorry) and their blue projectiles kill you
When the game ends a pop up will appear
"Oyunu kazandınız" means "You Won!"
"Oyunu kaybettiniz" means "You Lose!"
